**SLA (Service Level Agreement) metrics** for testing projects are measurable indicators that define the expected quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of testing services provided by a QA/testing team to its clients or stakeholders. These metrics help ensure that the testing process meets agreed-upon standards and business requirements.

### Common SLA Metrics for Testing Projects

1. **Test Case Execution Rate**
   - **Definition:** Percentage of planned test cases executed within the specified timeline.
   - **Formula:** (Number of test cases executed / Total planned test cases) × 100

2. **Defect Detection Rate**
   - **Definition:** Percentage of defects detected during a testing cycle.
   - **Formula:** (Number of defects detected / Total number of defects found post-release + during testing) × 100

3. **Defect Leakage**
   - **Definition:** Number or percentage of defects missed during testing and found in production.
   - **Formula:** (Defects found in production / Total defects found) × 100

4. **Test Coverage**
   - **Definition:** Percentage of application requirements or code covered by test cases.
   - **Formula:** (Requirements covered by test cases / Total requirements) × 100

5. **Test Execution Timeliness**
   - **Definition:** Percentage of test cycles completed within the agreed schedule.
   - **Formula:** (Number of test cycles completed on time / Total test cycles) × 100

6. **Defect Resolution Time**
   - **Definition:** Average time taken to resolve (fix and close) a defect.
   - **Formula:** (Total time to resolve all defects / Number of defects resolved)

7. **Test Environment Availability**
   - **Definition:** Amount of time the test environment is available for use as per the schedule.
   - **Formula:** (Actual environment uptime / Scheduled uptime) × 100

8. **First Time Pass Rate**
   - **Definition:** Percentage of test cases that pass on the first execution, without requiring rework.
   - **Formula:** (Number of test cases passed on first attempt / Total executed test cases) × 100

9. **Reopen Rate**
   - **Definition:** Percentage of defects that are reopened after being closed.
   - **Formula:** (Number of defects reopened / Total defects closed) × 100

10. **Customer/Stakeholder Satisfaction**
    - **Definition:** Qualitative or quantitative measure (e.g., survey score) of how satisfied stakeholders are with the QA process and deliverables.


### Example SLA Metrics

| Metric                     | Target Value | Calculation                                           |
|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| Stakeholder Satisfaction   | ≥ 4/5        | (Survey or feedback score)                            |

 
SLA metrics should be agreed upon between the QA team and stakeholders at the start of the project and reviewed regularly for continuous improvement. They serve as a baseline for measuring and improving the quality and efficiency of testing services.

| **Throughput**                | Context-specific           | Set based on API type, e.g., >1000 req/sec      |
| **Error Rate**                | <1%                        | Minimize errors; <0.1% for critical APIs        |
| **Latency**                   | <200ms                     | Lower latency is better for user experience     |
| **Uptime/Downtime**           | >99.9%                     | High availability; align with SLA               |
| **MTBF**                      | As high as possible        | Higher = more reliability                       |
| **MTTR**                      | As low as possible         | Lower = faster recovery from failures           |
| **Vulnerability Detection**   | 0                          | No vulnerabilities ideally                      |
| **Auth Coverage**             | 100%                       | All auth scenarios tested                       |

| **Schema Validation Errors**  | 0                          | All responses conform to schema                 |
| **Documentation Coverage**    | 100%                       | All endpoints documented and up-to-date         |
| **Documentation Defects**     | 0                          | No issues in API documentation                  |

**Notes:**
- “Context-specific” means the target should be agreed based on your API’s business requirements, expected load, and SLAs.
- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) and MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) targets depend on reliability goals; strive for high MTBF and low MTTR.
- Number of tests executed and build integration frequency should grow with product maturity and CI/CD adoption.

**target SLA** for Risk based testing metric, aligned with common industry best practices. These targets may vary based on your organization's risk appetite, domain, and maturity, but they serve as a strong baseline for most QA dashboards.

**Notes:**
- Targets should be reviewed and customized for your organization's context and risk tolerance.
- “Risk Coverage” and “Test Case Prioritization Coverage” aim for maximum coverage of high-priority and high-risk areas.
- “Defect Leakage” and “Severity Distribution” aim to minimize post-release issues, especially in high-risk categories.
- “Time to Detect High-Risk Defects” prioritizes rapid detection to reduce business impact.
- “Residual Risk” helps ensure only acceptable risk levels remain at release.

Here are **target values** (typical goals or benchmarks) for Security testing metrics listed below:

````

**Notes:**
- Targets should be adjusted based on risk, project phase, and organizational context.
- These targets help teams focus on risk reduction, remediation speed, and comprehensive coverage for secure software delivery.
- For "Vulnerability Trends Over Time," the goal is a continuous reduction in open vulnerabilities.
- For "Vulnerabilities by Module," the target is to avoid concentration of issues in any one module, indicating balanced security hygiene.
- "Test Coverage" should include static, dynamic, SCA, and other relevant security test types.  
- The "False Positive Rate" target keeps noise low, ensuring meaningful findings.
